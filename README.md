# CloudGuard SHIFTLEFT integration with CICD pipeline on AWS

Docker images often contain vulnerabilities that can allow an attacker to leverage when the application is at runtime - in UAT/Test and production environments. It's crucial for DevOps teams to ensure that the security is integrated into CICD Pipeline as early as possible when building your cloud native applications. Check Point's CloudGuard SHIFTLEFT is a security tool that can integrate into your CICD pipeline, and scan your containers for vulnerabilities. SHIFTLEFT can also scan application source codes and IaC such as Terraform for vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.

In this tutorial, I'll do a step-by-step walk-through of integrating CloudGuard SHIFTLEFT into your CICD Pipeline on AWS. The integration will happen at the build stage. 

NOTE: This tutorial is **not complete** yet and it is work in progress.

![header image](img/SHIFTLEFT-AWS-new.png)
# Prerequisites

### Tools 
 You need the following tools on your computer:

* AWS CLI [Install AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html).
* Docker (If you want to test local Docker build)
* [SHIFTLEFT](https://github.com/dome9/shiftleft)

Note: This is an **ALL-AWS** tutorial which means we'll be using CICD services provided by **AWS ONLY**. However, CloudGuard can be integrated with any other automation tools that can create CICD pipeline.

### AWS and CloudGuard 

* AWS Account
* Access to Check Point Infinity portal (For now, the scan result can be viewed only on Infinity portal. Hopefully, we'll make it available on CloudGuard console soon.)

### AWS IAM Roles needed for the following AWS services

- The IAM role(s) will be created as part of creating a CodeBuild project. Please take note that the role used by CodeBuild requires permissions to access to a number of AWS resources such as S3. 

    1. AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryPowerUser 
    2. An Inline Policy that allows it to "PUT OBJECT" to S3 Bucket that you've created. This is for uploading scan result to S3. (See JSON below)

```
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "Stmt1602483338347",
      "Action": [
        "s3:PutObject"
      ],
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::[YOUR-BUCKET-ARN]/*"
    }
  ]
}
```

> Please make sure that you UPDATE the resource **ARN** with the **ARN of the S3 bucket** you've created!

3. Finally, you need to add another in-line policy for Codebuild to access CloudGuard credentials stored in AWS SSM parameter store. I'll explain in detail at [a later stage](#Add-an-in-line-policy-to-CodeBuild-Role). 

# What exactly we will be doing

In this tutorial, we'll be doing the followings;

1. Create an AWS ECR repo \
(Yes if you'd like to follow along my ALL-AWS tutorial, you'll need to create an ECR repo which will store the docker image.)
2. Create a CodeCommit Repo
3. Generate CloudGuard API Key and Secret
4. CodeBuild Project Configuration
5. Test the build with SHIFTLEFT
6. Integrate with AWS CodePipeline

---
# 1. Create an AWS ECR Repository
First you'll need to create a ECR on AWS. Your docker image (after build stage) will be stored in the ECR repo.

You can create the ECR repo on AWS web console or you can just execute the following command.

```bash
aws ecr create-repository --repository-name project-a/my-docker
```

**Take note of the Docker Image URI!You will need it later**

![header image](img/ecr-uri.png)        

---
# 2. Create a CodeCommit Repository

Then you'll need to create a CodeCommit repo on AWS. We need the CodeCommit repo to store the "source" files that we'll use to build a docker image later in the tutorial. And the Docker image will then be uploaded to the ECR repo.

 You can create a CodeCommit repo on AWS web console or you can just execute the following command.

```bash
aws codecommit create-repository --repository-name my-docker-repo --repository-description "My Docker Repo"
```

Then you'll need to do 'git clone your CodeCommit repo' via either SSH or HTTP. It'll be an empty repository first. (This CodeCommit will be used to host the source codes which we will use to build a Docker image.) Then you will need to download the source files (zip) into your local repo [here](https://github.com/jaydenaung/CloudGuard-ShiftLeft-CICD-AWS/blob/main/src.zip) 

- Unzip the source files. You'll need to **make sure that "src" folder and Dockerfile are in the same root directory in order for Docker build to work**.
- Remove the zip file 
- Download the Dockerfile & buildspec.yml 

**In your CodeCommit local directory, you should have the following folder and files**.

1. src (directory where source codes are)
2. Dockerfile
3. buildspec.yml (This file isn't needed for Docker image however, it is required to CodeBuild)

- Then you'll need to do `git init`, `git add -A`, `git commit -m "Your message"` and `git push` (This will upload your local files to  your CodeCommit repository)
- Above-mentioned files in your local directory should now be uploaded to your CodeCommit repo.

> You can also download [shiftleft-binary.zip](https://github.com/jaydenaung/CloudGuard-ShiftLeft-CICD-AWS/blob/main/shiftleft-binary.zip) for shiftleft executables for Windows,Linux and MacOs.

[Check out the how SHIFTLEFT works and command line usage here.](https://github.com/dome9/shiftleft)

# 3. GENERATE CLOUDGUARD API KEY AND SECRET

SHIFTLEFT requires CloudGuard's API key and API secrets in order to run assessments. In Build stage, we'll need to export them into buildspec.yml securely. You can generate CloudGuard API key and API secrets on CloudGuard web console. 

Check out [How to generate CloudGuard API and API Secret](https://supportcenter.checkpoint.com/supportcenter/portal?eventSubmit_doGoviewsolutiondetails=&solutionid=sk144514&partition=General&product=CloudGuard)

***[IMPORTANT] DO NOT HARDCODE YOUR API KEYS AND SECRETS IN BUILDSPEC.YML IF POSSIBLE***

CloudGuard API key and secret that you've just generated need to be declared in buildspec.yml and exported as variables for SHIFTLEFT to use as credentials. It's easier to just hard-code them in the buildspecs.yml in plain text. However, that is not in line with security best practices. You do not want these credentials to be clearly visible in buildspec.yml. (Think DevSecOps)

So here is what we are gonna do (The secure way):

* We'll store your CloudGuard API key and secret in AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store. We'll need to create two AWS SSM Parameters for "CHKP_CLOUDGUARD_ID" and "CHKP_CLOUDGUARD_SECRET".

*  Then we'll add "ssm:GetParameter" in-line policy to the IAM role that's used by CodeBuild.

*  We'll then embed a couple of commands in buildspec.yml which calls AWS API to access SSM parameters for CloudGuard API key and secret (instead embedding of hard-coded values).

> Note: You can also use AWS Secrets Manager to store credentials.

### Create AWS SSM Parameters 

1. Go to AWS Management > "Systems Manager"
2. Choose "Parameter Store"
3. Create a parameter for "CHKP_CLOUDGUARD_ID", and enter your CloudGuard API key. (Choose "String")
4. Create a parameter for "CHKP_CLOUDGUARD_SECRET" and enter your CloudGuard Secret. (Choose "String)

And buildspec.yml will instruct Codebuild to access these parameters required for SHIFTLEFT when in build stage. 

> Optionally, you can choose "SecureString" in which chase the string will be encrypted using KMS keys from your account.

![header image](img/ssm-create.png)

--- 
### Using AWS Secrets Manager to store CloudGuard API key and Secret 

In addition to storing API keys and secrets in AWS SSM, you can store CloudGuard API Key and Secret in Secrets Manager. Please check out [How To Store CloudGuard API Key and Secret in Secrets Manager](secretsmanager.md) as well.

---
### Add an in-line policy to CodeBuild Role

At this stage, Codebuild IAM role is not yet created. So, **Just Remember to add the following in-line policy** to the CodeBuild role when it gets created as part of CodeBuild project configuration. This will allow CodeBuild to access to the AWS SSM parameters that we've just created. 

(Of course alternatively, you can create a Codebuild role in advance for you to use at the stage when you create the build project.)

Below is a sample in-line policy in JSON format.

``` bash
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "Stmt1603607884407",
      "Action": [
        "ssm:GetParameter"
      ],
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:ssm:ap-southeast-1:YOURACCOUNTNO:parameter/CHKP_CLOUDGUARD_ID"
    },
    {
      "Sid": "Stmt1603607963982",
      "Action": [
        "ssm:GetParameter"
      ],
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:ssm:ap-southeast-1:YOURACCOUNTNO:parameter/CHKP_CLOUDGUARD_SECRET"
    }
  ]
}
```
> Update resource ARNs with the ARNs of your CloudGuard API Key and Secret. Execute ```aws ssm get-parameter --name "CHKP_CLOUDGUARD_ID"``` and ```aws ssm get-parameter --name "CHKP_CLOUDGUARD_SECRET"``` to get the ARNs.
---
# 4. CodeBuild Project Configuration

Before creating a CodeBuild project you'll first need to do the followings;

1. Create S3 Bucket for Build artifacts (Vulnerability Scan result)
2. Update buildspec.yml

### S3 Bucket
You'll also need to create an S3 bucket to upload and store a copy of SHIFTLEFT vulnerability scan result.

A copy of scan result is uploaded to Check Point Infinity portal (for now). Hopefully, the scan result will be available on CloudGuard (Dome9) portal soon. ***I cannot commit on this.***


```bash
aws s3 mb s3://Your-Bucket-Name
```


## [buildspec.yml](https://github.com/jaydenaung/CloudGuard-ShiftLeft-CICD-AWS/blob/main/buildspec.yml)

Buildspec.yml instructs CodeBuild in build stage in terms of what to do. Basically, buildspec.yml will instruct AWS CodeBuild to automatically scan the docker image for vulnerability during build stage. And AWS CodeBuild will follow the steps declared in the buildspec.yml file. So this is an **important** configuration file. 

**[IMPORTANT]** In the buildspec.yml, look for **#UPDATE** comments and replace the values with your own values accordingly.

In the buildspec.yml you will also see that the SHIFTLEFT binary will be downloaded from [my lab S3 bucket](https://jaydenstaticwebsite.s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/download/shiftleft). It is a Linux x64 executable file and I uploaded it for the purpose of this lab. In your case, you can upload your own SHIFTLEFT binary to your S3 bucket or whichever repo that can host the file.

### Create a CodeBuild Project on AWS Management Console 

On AWS Console;

1. Go to "CodeBuild" 
2. If you don't already have a codebuild project, choose "Create Project".


![header image](img/codebuild-1.png)

3. Add "CodeCommit" as source
4. Choose the CodeCommit repo that you've created earlier.
5. Choose "Master" branch

![header image](img/codebuild-source.png)


In CodeBuild windows, do the following;

6. Enter your project name
7. Choose "Managed Image" and "Ubuntu" as Operating system

![header image](img/codebuild-2.png)


8. Choose "Standard" & "Standard:4.0" (It's totally up to you to choose actually.)
9. Check "Privileged ...." checkbox
10. Choose an existing role or create a new service role.
**(Add SSM:get-parameter in-line policy to this role!)**


> Now, please take note that codebuild role requires permissions to access to S3 bucket, ECR repo, and SSM parameter store.

![header image](img/codebuild-3.png)


And Finally:

11. Ensure that you configure "Artifacts" **(THIS IS IMPORTANT)**
12. Choose "S3" bucket  & In "Bucket Name", Enter the S3 Bucket that you've created earlier
13. In "Name", Define a folder ***(e.g. output)***

Check out that the build has been completed.

![header image](img/buildcomplete.png)

Finally, you can check and verify that SHIFTLEFT has been integrated with CodeBuild, and runs an assessment on the docker image.


On AWS Console, go to "S3", and the S3 bucket that we've created for storing artifacts while configuring CodeBuild project. In the "output" folder, you should see "result.txt" which basically is the vulnerability scan report generated by SHIFTLEFT. 

**NOTE**
A copy of the result has been sent to [Check Point Infinity Portal](https://portal.checkpoint.com/). If you have access to infinity portal, you can view the scan result on the portal. (Hopefully, this will be available on CloudGuard portal soon)
Otherwise, in result.txt, you can see a number of vulnerabilities found in the docker image!

			Description: A buffer overflow exists in the Brotli library versions prior to 1.0.8 where an attacker controlling the input length of a "one-shot" decompression request to a script can trigger a crash, which happens when copying over chunks of data larger than 2 GiB. It is recommended to update your Brotli library to 1.0.8 or later. If one cannot update, we recommend to use the "streaming" API as opposed to the "one-shot" API, and impose chunk size limits.

# 6. Integrate with AWS CodePipeline 

You have successfully integrated SHIFTLEFT with AWS CodeBuild. If you want to take a step further, and integrate SHIFTLEFT with AWS CodePipeline, you can do so easily. You can create a CodePipeline, using your CodeCommit repo as source and Codebuild in the build stage (use the Codebuild project that you've created.). So every time you make changes to the docker image source files in CodeCommit repo, a pipeline execution in CodePipeline will be started, running a revision through every stage and action in the pipeline. While in build stage of the pipeline, SHIFTLEFT will be triggered to scan the docker image. In this way, a SHIFTLEFT assessment is triggered every time a new docker image is built, and you can fully integrate SHIFTLEFT into your CICD pipeline on AWS!

An easy and quick way to create a CodePipeline is using AWS CLI. You can download [my-codepipeline.json](my-codepipeline.json) from this Github repo which is a sample CodePipeline JSON file I've created for this lab. You can update the JSON file with your own values, and execute the following CLI.


```bash
aws codepipeline create-pipeline --cli-input-json file://my-codepipeline.json
```
This will basically create a CodePipeline!

Once the CodePipeline is set up, you can observe events in each stage of pipeline execution once it's started. You can also start the pipeline execution by making changes to the source code in the CodeCommit repo (followed by committing the code using git commands). Only this time, your docker image will be scanned for vulnerabilities by CloudGuard SHIFTLEFT every time a new docker image is built. 

Happy DevSecOps-ing! \

## Things to take note

1. One of the issues you might probably encounter in Build is the build stage might fail due to IAM insufficient permissions. Ensure that **the CodeBuild IAM role** has the sufficient permissions attached to it.

2. Once CodePipeline has been set up, the artifact (result.txt) will be uploaded to CodePipeline's artifact S3, rather than CodeBuild's artifact S3 bucket. So if you still want to copy the scan result to the CodeBuild's artifact store S3 bucket, please add the following command to the "buildspec.yml".

``` bash
aws s3 cp result.txt s3://your-codebuild-artifacts-s3-bucket/result.txt
```
